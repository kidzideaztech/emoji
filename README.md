# Emoji

This repository contains the emoji map file that KidzIdeazTECH pulls from. Want your own emoji added? Think it's something useful but dont want to pay the 750 KidzCoin? You've come to the right place.

## I have an emoji image URL
If you have an emoji and it already has a file, you can create a pull request. Simply add a new line to the emoji.txt file (it's actually JSON). Your image URL must be on a high-redundancy CDN which must load quickly, or it'll be rejected.

## I have an emoji file
If you have a file, but not an image URL, thats fine! Just create an Issue asking for it, and upload your file there. We can put it into the emoji filesystem, and add it in

## I just have a suggestion, but no image
Create an Issue with your suggestion
